  Commenting styles in Pascal

  There are several ways you can write a comment in Pascal/Delphi/Pascal Script.
  This example will show and explain them to you.

  In this example "//>" means this line is part of a "(* title *)".
}

(* General info: *)
//>  "(*...*)" - Can be used for both single- and multi-line comments
//>  "{...}"   - Can be used for both single- and multi-line comments
//>  "//"      - Can be used for single-line comments
//>
//>  A comment that contains a dollar sign ($) immediately after the opening { or (* is a compiler directive.
//>  For example: {$WARNINGS OFF}
//>  This tells the compiler not to generate warning messages.


(* Comment hierarchy: *)
//>  (* Highest precedence *)
//>  { Second precedence }
//>  // Lowest precedence


(* Comment-style combinations: *)
//>  (*
//>    Can be used to coment out code containing:
//>    { This comment style }
//>    // And this comment style
//>  *)
//>
//>  {
//>    Can be used to comment out code containing:
//>    (* This comment style *)
//>    // And this comment style
//>  }
//>
//>  // Can be used to comment out the single-line version of: (* comment *) and { comment }


(* Embarcadero recommendations: *)
//>  Use the double-slash "//" for commenting out temporary changes made during development.
//>
//>  Use the parenthesis-star "(*...*)" both for development comments and for commenting out a block of code that contains other comments.
//>  This comment character permits multiple lines of source, including other types of comments, to be removed from consideration by the compiler.
//>
//>  Use the braces "{...}" for in-source documentation that you intend to remain with the code.


(* Trivia *)
//>  The "(*...*)" comment style exists to support (really) old keyboards that have no '{' and '}' keys.
