DONE/FIXED:
 - Go-to does not accept user input
 - some top menu items are disabled, yet accessible from buttons, e.g. "Find"
 - it's nicer to have extension shown "Dynamic scripts (.script)" and also have the second option below "All files (.)"
 - "open-as read-only" seems to be useless
 - Simplify and fix tab closing bugs (Mainly side panel visibility messing up after closing welcome page)
 - ExtractRelativePath(SE.EXE, 'items in recent and examples lists');
 - open dialog should start in SE folder (closer to scripts being edited)
 - would it make more sense to move issues panel to be below the script text?
 - make the center area to take more space and sidebars narrower
 - Fix odd splitter behaviour
 - AC suggestion popup is not resizable
 - Tab is random, not 2 spaces (Disabled smart tabs)
 - list on left (e.g. Actions) isn't sorted (Cinematic*** come in the end)
 - Remove additional blank line in lists and suggestion
 - 

SUGGESTIONS:
 - add an option to show/hide method arguments in left panel
 - warn the user somehow when double-clicking a method on left pane if the cursor is in the middle of some line
 - when typing Actions. and Ctrl+space the list of suggestions should not repeat the "Actions." before each method
 - 

TODO:
 - Remove spacing line in panels and suggestions
 - 
 
BUGS:
 - Error message pops up when clicking on the left panel border
 - Windows defender is a whiney little sh*t
 - tried to Validate Romans_fort script, got a Invalid script validator response (verify)
